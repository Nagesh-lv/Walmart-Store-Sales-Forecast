# Retail Store Inventory and Sales Forecasting


### Project Overview
In this project, you are a Data Scientist working for a retail chain that operates multiple outlets across the country. The company is facing challenges in managing inventory to match demand with supply. Your goal is to analyze the provided sales data, uncover useful insights for store optimization, and build predictive models to forecast sales for the upcoming 12 weeks. These insights will assist in better inventory management, improving sales, and aligning supply with customer demand.

### Problem Statement
Inventory management is critical for any retail store to avoid stockouts or overstock situations. The retail chain is looking to forecast sales in order to manage inventory more effectively. By understanding the sales trends, store performance, and external factors influencing sales, the store can make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.

### Objectives:
Data Analysis and Insight Generation: Identify key factors that impact sales performance and provide actionable insights to help the stores improve.
Sales Forecasting: Build a predictive model to forecast sales for each store over the next 12 weeks, considering various influencing factors.

### Dataset Information:
The dataset, walmart.csv, contains 6435 rows and 8 columns, with data spanning across multiple stores. Each row corresponds to the sales data for a given store and week.

### Features:
Store: Store number (unique identifier for each store).
Date: The week of sales.
Weekly_Sales: Sales for the given store in that week.
Holiday_Flag: Binary flag indicating if the week included a holiday (1 = Holiday week, 0 = Non-holiday week).
Temperature: The temperature on the sales day (in Fahrenheit).
Fuel_Price: The cost of fuel in the region (USD).
CPI: Consumer Price Index, a measure of the average price of consumer goods.
Unemployment: The unemployment rate in the region.

### Project Structure
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting dates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing analysis to identify patterns in sales, store performance, and external factors like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment.
Insights Generation: Analyzing the impact of holidays, weather, and economic factors on sales performance across different stores.
Feature Engineering: Creating additional features that may improve model accuracy (e.g., seasonal trends, sales lags, moving averages).
Sales Forecasting: Building predictive models to forecast sales for the next 12 weeks for each store.
Model Evaluation & Tuning: Evaluating the model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and adjusting the model to improve accuracy.

### Tools & Technologies
Python: Main language used for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations to better understand sales trends.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Statsmodels: For time series forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and modeling.
